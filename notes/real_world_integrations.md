# Using IceNet in the real world

## Overview

The purpose of this runthrough is to elaborate on how the technical implementation gives rise to a variety of end user use-cases in the real world:

* How derived products and services facilitate conservation efforts.
* How direct integration with data products facilitate external system development.
* How the establishment of a novel infrastructure facilitates development of standard and generalisable AI platforms.
* How considering all of these elements helps us to work towards development of information management frameworks.

## Detail to go through

### The WWF technical developments

Then points to the value add use case demonstrated by Ellie: this is a run through of how the infrastructure itself assists that use case (alerting, forecasting, analysis tools.)

Follow up: go see Ellie on the conservation demonstrator at the IceNet stand!

### The SDA system integration

We highlight the use of IceNet data product within the SDA route planner platform from a technical standpoint, demonstrating the internal Digital Twins being built within BAS. 

Follow up: go see the SDA team on the Route Planning exhibition stand!

### Generalisable AI platforms

We highlight the generalised nature of the AI pipeline in use, as well as surrounding infrastructure, for doing research and prediction of other forms. 

Follow up: go see Tom and Ryan on the ML research and validation stand, or talk to James or Scott Hosking further about how BAS and Turing are looking to capitalise on this! 

### Information Management Frameworks

We highlight the use of IceNet as a challenge use case in the NERC IMFe project, focusing on environmental Digital Twins. IceNet presents an opportunity to apply the conceptual IMFe to an extant infrastructure.

Follow up: Talk to James about that project and visit the IMFe stand!
